Implementation of Analytical queries like Roll_UP, CUBE, First,
Last, Rank AND Dense Rank.

CREATE TABLE emp (
empno NUMBER(4) CONSTRAINT pk_emp PRIMARY KEY,
ename VARCHAR2(10),
job VARCHAR2(9),

); 
-----------------------------
SELECT empno,

RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal) AS

------------------------------
DENSE_RANK
------------------------------
SELECT empno,
deptno,
sal,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY deptno ORDER BY sal)
AS myrank
FROM emp; 
------------------------------
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT empno,

FROM emp)
WHERE myrank <= 2; 
-----------------------------
SELECT empno,

OVER (PARTITION BY deptno) AS lowest,

ORDER BY deptno, sal;
----------------------------
LEAD
----------------------------
SELECT empno,

LEAD(sal, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sal) AS sal_next,
LEAD(sal, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY sal) - sal AS sal_diff
